> âœ¨ A quick and beginner-friendly project that teaches you how to build a simple neural network (a tiny artificial brain!) using Python + PyTorch. Train it to learn patterns like a human would â€” and all of this in just 10 minutes!

## ðŸ“š About the Dataset

This project uses the **MNIST dataset** in IDX format â€” a classic dataset of handwritten digits (0 to 9).

| File Name                 | Description                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `train-images-idx3-ubyte` | 60,000 training digit images   |
| `train-labels-idx1-ubyte` | Labels (0â€“9) for training data |
| `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte`  | 10,000 test digit images       |
| `t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte`  | Labels for test data           |

The images are 28x28 grayscale and are loaded using Python's `struct` module.

```python
# Example: Code to visualize first few training images
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 10, figsize=(15, 2))
for i in range(10):
    axes[i].imshow(train_images[i][0], cmap="gray")
    axes[i].set_title(f"Label: {train_labels[i].item()}")
    axes[i].axis("off")
plt.show()
