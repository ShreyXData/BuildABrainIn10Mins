## ðŸ“š About the Dataset

This project uses the **MNIST dataset** in IDX format â€” a classic dataset of handwritten digits (0 to 9).

| File Name                 | Description                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `train-images-idx3-ubyte` | 60,000 training digit images   |
| `train-labels-idx1-ubyte` | Labels (0â€“9) for training data |
| `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte`  | 10,000 test digit images       |
| `t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte`  | Labels for test data           |

The images are 28x28 grayscale and are loaded using Python's `struct` module.
