# 🧠 Build A Brain in 10 Minutes

Welcome to **Build A Brain in 10 Minutes** – a fun, beginner-friendly machine learning project where we train a tiny AI to **recognise clothes** using **TensorFlow** and the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. 👕👗👞

This notebook is like teaching a baby robot to look at outfits and say, “Aha! That’s a sneaker!” 🤖💡  
Perfect if you're just getting started with AI or want a quick refresher on neural networks!

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn
- How to load and visualise the Fashion MNIST dataset
- How to normalise image data for neural networks
- How to build a simple neural network using TensorFlow
- How to train a model and check its performance
- All explained with **clear comments** and **emojis** to make it fun and accessible! 🎉

## 🧰 Tools Used
```python
import numpy as np            # Array & math magic
import pandas as pd           # Data wrangling
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Pretty plots
import tensorflow as tf       # The brain engine 🧠
import torch                  # Bonus: PyTorch peek
